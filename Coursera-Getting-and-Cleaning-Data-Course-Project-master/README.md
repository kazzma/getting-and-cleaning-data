## Files Used

The code takes all the data is present in the same directory.

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to tidy up the data.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called `averages.txt`.
